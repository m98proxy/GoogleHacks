# GoogleHacks
GoogleHacks throws together a C# API for google maps 
specifically google street view integration with C#/OpenTK projects.
The API within provides sampling input of 6 Skybox images (front, back, left, right, up, down)
mapping them to a skybox using the X3D Background node.


The toolkit used is X3D-finely-sharpened built purely in C#,

3D rendering API provided by OpenTK an OpenGL wrapper.



Project currently in development, come back soon.
